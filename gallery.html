                <p>The Konark Sun Temple was built in 1250 CE during the reign of the Eastern Ganga King Narsimhadeva-1
                    from stone in the form of a giant ornamented chariot dedicated to the Sun god, Surya. The Konark
                    Temple was built by King Narasimha Deva I in 1244 to worship Surya, the Sun God. Konark was chosen
                    as its place of construction because it has been described as the holy seat of Surya in various
                    ancient texts.</p>
